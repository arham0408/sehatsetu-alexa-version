# Product feedback and observed friction

Based on local development on October 25, 2026. These are post-submission observations, not claims about the team's event-period experience. Add independently verified event-period feedback separately.

| Tool | Used for / what worked | Limitations / onboarding | Would use again? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Official MCP Python SDK | Typed report tools, discovery, Streamable HTTP, independent client verification | Pin the maintenance-line version and use matching documentation. FastAPI hosting needs explicit session-manager lifespan ownership. | Yes, with transport-level tests and explicit versions. |
| FastAPI and Pydantic | Existing report APIs and validation; parent app hosts the MCP endpoint | Keep the MCP mount after REST routes; configure origin/host allowlists. Existing report processing reduced setup work. | Yes, with a dedicated ingestion/provenance layer for broader use. |
| PyMuPDF | Existing PDF text extraction; generated-PDF backend tests | Scanned files need OCR. Passing extracted text into MCP loses original page positions. | Yes, with explicit OCR and provenance handling. |
| Groq | Existing optional extraction/chat provider reused by MCP | Configure server-side key. No authenticated live request was validated in this pass; translation, latency, and clinical accuracy remain unverified. Long context is truncated. | Evaluate after authenticated tests on synthetic multilingual cases. |
| Browser Web Speech API | Existing audio controller reused for microphone input and speech output | Browser permission, secure origin, voices, and recognition coverage vary. Automated tests use typed input; physical microphone/audio quality needs manual review. | Yes for a prototype, with a supported-browser matrix. |
| React, Vite, Three.js | Existing atlas supports verified navigation; Vite proxies both APIs and MCP | Large model downloads/bundle; physical-phone performance needs separate testing. Install dependencies and run both services. | Yes, with future bundle splitting and device profiling. |
| Playwright | Two browser surfaces, real backend requests, revocation, mobile layout | Matching Chromium must be installed separately from npm dependencies. | Yes, as a repeatable integration check. |

No gated Alexa+ SDK, Echo connection, Alexa developer-console integration, or AWS runtime is used here. The project follows the official simulation path. First-hand SDK/device or AWS feedback cannot be supplied for tools we did not use.

## Observed friction log

| Task and steps | Expected vs actual | Severity | Workaround | Suggested improvement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Restart the same MCP manager across separate test-app lifespans | Expected repeatable starts; SDK rejects running the same manager instance twice | Medium | Use one test-class app lifespan and reset application sessions between tests | Document test fixture lifetime beside mounting examples |
| Return an unparameterized `dict` from a tool and consume `structuredContent` | Expected structured output; received JSON text content instead | Low | Annotate `dict[str, Any]`; retain text-content parsing fallback in browser client | Include generic-container return annotations and robust response parsing in examples |
| Launch the browser test after npm installation | Expected a browser; matching Chromium executable absent | Low | Run `npx playwright install chromium` | Keep browser installation explicit in setup and CI |

## Feature requests

- **Important:** an accessible Alexa+ integration sandbox for true assistant/device invocation alongside self-hosted MCP tools. The official FAQ currently points entrants toward their own simulators.
- **Important:** document provenance carried through ingestion and tool/model responses to support original-page evidence.
- **Nice-to-have:** consistent multilingual browser speech capability reporting before users begin a conversation.
