# SehatSetu review pack

**Alexa+ primary-track prototype: a voice-first report companion with verified 3D anatomy and a real Streamable HTTP MCP server.**

[Watch the team demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teRzrT49HVo) · [Project README](../../README.md) · [Local demo](http://localhost:3016/?demo=1)

The local link works after starting the two services on your own computer. The video page resolves to the expected SehatSetu title. Automated playback encountered YouTube's bot check; footage and runtime need manual inspection. The runnable browser/MCP workflow has been verified independently.

## What to expect

The core evaluation needs no login, Alexa hardware, AWS account, or paid inference. Typed questions work without a microphone. No-key mode returns English report excerpts; conversational reasoning and translation require a configured Groq provider. A separate browser tab can demonstrate pairing without another physical device.

For verification evidence rather than feature descriptions alone, use the [JSON protocol result](evidence/mcp-verification.json), [verification record](VERIFICATION.md), and [repeatable judge walkthrough](JUDGE_GUIDE.md).
